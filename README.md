## Installation
- Note that this installation has not been tested on multiple devices and is unlikely to work out of the box.
- Download the software above and install the software above.
- The username should be 'pi'.
- Install config files and systemd files with 'update_*.sh' scripts.

## Presets

### Tuning

**12edo.** Used in contemporary music. Limited use in classical Chinese music.

**24edo.** Used in contemporary arabic music.

**17edo.** Approximates classical Iranian music.

**29edo.** Approximates classical Arabic music.

**9ed3/2.** Wendy Carlos's Alpha Scale. Can also be used to approximate maqam Saba in Arabic music.

**19edo.** Approximates 1/3 meantone tuning used in classical European music from the 1600s.

**31edo.** Approximates 1/4 meantone tuning used in classical European music from the 1600s.

**13ed3.** Bohlen--Pierce Scale used in experimental music.

**7edo.** Used in Bantu music (e.g. in Zimbabwean music).

**5edo.** Used in Bantu music (e.g. in Ugandan music) and Indonesian classical music

**9edo.** Approximates Indonesian classical music.

**53edo.** Approximates Indian classical music. Also approximates Turkish music and music from the Western Sahel (e.g. Mali).

### Layouts

**Exquis.** Similar to Gerhard and harmonic table.

**Accordion B.**

**Accordion C.**

**Wicki-Hayden.** Used on some bandone√≥ns.

**Jazz.** Not in use elsewhere what I know of. Good for playing jazzy chords and shell voicings. Semi-isomorphic (i.e. you have to learn two shapes for each chord rather than 1).

## Mistakes
- Reface CP does allow microtuning but only monophonically, maybe I should have gotten a Korg Minilogue XD instead?
- Blokas Midihub was meant to retune the Reface CP and it can do this, but I should just have gone directly to buying a Raspberry Pi 5 instead.
- Raspberry Pi 4, I had a good deal for, but you really want the CPU of the 5.
