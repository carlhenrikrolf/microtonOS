# Greek Classical Music

**Ancient.**
String instruments such as harps were common in ancient Greek music.
String instruments were also used for music-theoretical investigations.
The basis of tuning was [Pythagorean](pythagorean.md), although many variants were proposed by different philosophers.
Scales, known as a γένος (genus), spanned perfect fourth, and two scales were put together to get an octave.
Different modes of each genus were also in use.

|   |24edo |
|---|---|
| διατονικὸν γένος <br /> (diatonic genus) | 4, 8, 10 |
| χρωματικὸν γένος <br /> (chromatic genus) | 2, 4, 10 |
| ἐναρμόνιον γένος <br /> (enharmonic genus) | 1, 2, 10 |

24edo is an approximation of the tuning.
Note that the words diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic have acquired alternative meanings in modern usage.

**Byzantine (East–Roman).**
Medieval Greek music is associated with Gregorian chanting.
The diatonic genus had been doubled to form an octave-spanning scale.
Four modes were in use with two versions of each mode.

|-----|-------|
| ἦχος πρῶτος <br /> (first, dorian) | 2, 3, 5, <br /> 7, 9(8), 10, 12 |
| ἦχος δεύτερος <br /> (second, phrygian) | 1, 3, 5, <br /> 7, 8, 10, 12 |
| ἦχος τρίτος <br /> (third, lydian)| 2, 4, 6(5), <br /> 7, 9, 11, 12 |
| ἦχος τέταρτος <br /> (fourth, mixolydian) | 2, 4, 5, <br /> 7, 9, 10, 12 |

The plagal modes are not shown as they only differ subtly from the four above.
Notes in parentheses can sometimes be used as replacements.

**Ottoman.**
As part of the Ottoman empire, Greek music (e.g. rebetika or smyrneika music) was deeply influenced by [Turkish music](turkish.md).
Instruments such as the bouzouki were introduced.
However, unlike in Turkish music, it was fretted according to an even 12-tone scale.
Many of the Turkish modes (makam) were translated into 12-tone scales.

|------|-------|
| χιτζαζσκιάρ <br /> (hicazkâr) | 1, 4, 5, <br /> 7, 8, 11, 12 |
| χιτζάζ <br /> (hicaz) | 1, 4, 5, <br /> 7, 8, 10, 12 |
| χουζάμ <br />(hüzzam) | 1, 3, 4, <br /> 7, 8, 9, 11 |
| σουζινάκ <br /> (sûzinak) | 2, 3, 6, <br /> 7, 8, 10, 12 |
| ραστ <br /> (rast) | 2, 4, 5, <br /> 7, 9, 11(10), 12 |
| νιαβέντ <br />(nihâvend) | 2, 3, 6, <br /> 7, 8, 11, 12 |
| χουσεϊνί <br /> (hüseynî) | 2, 4, 5, <br /> 7, 9(8), 10, 12 |
| καρτζικιάρ <br /> (karcığar) | 2, 3, 5, <br /> 6, 9, 10, 12 |
| σεγκιάχ <br /> (segâh) | 1, 3, 5, <br /> 7, 8, 10, 12 |
| ζαμπά <br /> (sabâ) | 2, 3, 4, <br /> 7, 8, 10, 11 |

Κιουρντί (kürdî) and ουσάκ (uşşâk) are some additional scales, but in Greek music, they are indistinguishable from segâh.
The parenthetical notes are primarily associated with downward motion.
