# Turkish Classical Music

Turkish classical music shares many similarities with [Arabic music](arabic.md).
A big difference, however, is that it uses considerably smaller intervals.
They are around half as big as in Arabic music (and a quarter as big as in European music).
In particular, Turkish classical music is based on 53edo because of its excellent approxmation of [Pythagorean tuning](pythagorean.md).
Some more contemporary Turkish music relies more on 48edo to make it more compatible with European and American instruments.

|       |53edo  |48edo  |
|-------|-------|----
|çârgâh beşlisi | 9,18,22,31 | 8,16,20,28 |
|rast beşlisi | 9,17,22,31 | 8,15,20,28 |
|nikriz beşlisi, <br /> pençgâh beşlisi | 9,13,25,31 | 8,12,23,28 |
|kürdi dörtlüsü | 5,13,22 | 5,12,20 |
|sabâ dörtlüsü | 8,13,17 | 7,12,15|
|segâh beşlisi | 5,14,22,32 | 5,13,20,26 |
|hüzzam beşlisi | 5,14,18,32 | 5,13,18,26 |
|ferahnâk beşlisi | 5,14,23,32 | 5,13,21,28 |

Scales are combined to form a (usually octave-spanning) scale for a makam.
When descending, notes may in some cases be played one step lower.
