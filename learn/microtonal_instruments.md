# Microtonal Instruments

## Traditional

Below are some traditional methods for dealing with microtonality.
Common problems is that either microtonal control is very fine, but difficult to learn, or it is realtively easy to learn but switching from one microtonal scale to another is difficult.

**Continuous.**
The human voice can of course hit every microtonal pitch within a span.
Instruments like violin, oud, trombone, etc. mimic this property.
Modern instruments such as the theremin also falls in this category.
The drawback is that it is difficult to learn---especially when learning music from other cultures!

**Scale tunings.**
Certain string and percussion instruments can be tuned to a microtonal scale.
In harps or zithers, each string can be tuned separately, and therefore it is easy to tune them according to a certain microtonal scale.
The same principle is applied to marimbas, xylophones, mbiras, etc.
Modern instruments that can have this property include synthesisers.
Korg Minilogue XD, Sequential Take Five, Novation Peak, ASM Hydrasynth are just some examples of such synthesisers in production at the time of writing.
The drawback is that switching scales requires retuning which takes time---unless it is a synthesiser.

**Movable frets.**
Instruments such as the sitar or the baglama have moveable frets.
Modern instruments in this vein include guitars with moveable fretlets (a fret that is only applied to a single string) or entire fretboards that may be attached and detached from the guitar.
The drawback once again is that is that switching scales may take time.

**Switches.**
The qanun is a kind of zither where the lengths of strings can be adjusted by switches (also known as mandals).
That way, modulating quickly between different scales is possible.
A modern version is the oriental keyboard.
An oriental keybard is a synthesiser with piano keys as well as a second 1-octave manual with miniature keys.
The miniature keys are not meant for playing---instead they retune the corresponding piano keys (normally by a quartertone, but some can be programmed).
Manufacturers of oriental keyboards include Korg, Ketron, and Yamaha.
The drawbacks to this method are very minor!
That is why I use it for microtonOS.

## Xenharmonised

**Pitchbend.**
A pitch can be continuously detuned through various methods:
for string instruments by bending the string,
for wind instruments by changing the embouchure,
for synthesisers by using a pitchbend wheel.
A drawback is that it is often not that precise.
Many synthesisers bend all notes being played at one time rather than an individual note.

**Bisonoric tunings.**
Accordions and harmonicas can be tuned to produce different notes depending on the direction of airflow.
For example, bandone√≥ns produce different notes depending on whether the bellos are squeezed or pulled out.
Arabised accordions can produce quartertones in this way.

**Isomorphic layouts.**
It is of course possible to retune a piano or other Halberstadt layout to any tuning.
However, it can be difficult to do without the white and black keys completely loosing their meaning--especially when the tuning contains more than 12 tones per octave.
A popular approach in more experimental xenharmonic music is to use an isomorphic layout.
You still have to learn new fingerings, but one chord uses the same fingering regardless of its root, so it is easier to learn.
There are few drawbacks to this--especially when the keys can have different colours---which is why I use it for microtonOS.

**Multiple manuals.**
It is possible to get an intuitive microtonal layout by using two piano keyboards or keyboard midi controllers and all the keys of one keyboard by a quartertone.
That results in a 24edo tuning, but other tunings are possible as well.
The archicembalo uses two manuals with so called split keys.
These are small black keys normally placed on top of the (bigger) black keys.
This way it is possible to use 31edo in an intuitive layout.
These methods have few drawbacks---especially when used with electronic instruments---which is why I use it for microtonOS.

**Shift buttons.**
In music, a shift button is a button that changes the functions of other controls either when pressed or toggled on or off.
This usage of 'shift' is related to its use in type writers and computer keyboards although it is not exactly the same.
Arabised transistor organs have used buttons to change some keys into quartertones.
Arabised trumpets have used extra valves to get quartertones.
Once again there are very few drawbacks, and this method is used in microtonOS.

**Autotune.**
Autotuning is the method of shifting pitch to the nearest 'correct' pitch through the use of software.
Most autotuning software shifts pitches to 12edo or a scale based on 12edo.
Some microtonal autotuning software includes AutoTune (which has given name to this class of software), AutoTalent, XentoTune, and Melodyne.
The latter two are polyphonic.
Some autotuning can only be used in production and some can also be used live.
My plan is to add this to a later version of microtonOS.
