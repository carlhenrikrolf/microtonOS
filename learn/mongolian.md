Apart from Mongolia, similar music exists in the Tuva and Altai regions in Russia as well as in Tibet. The area is notable for throat-singing in which different harmonics are emphasised at different times to form a melody. Notable instruments include the jaw harp and the horse-head fiddle.

|                        | harmonics       | ratios              | register |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| хөөмей<br>(khoomei)    | 8,9,10,12       | 1,9/8,5/4,3/2       | middle   |
| сыгыт<br>(sygyt)       | 8,9,10,12       | 1,9/8,5/4,3/2       | high     |
| каргыраа<br>(kargyraa) | 6,8,<br>9,10,12 | 1,4/3,<br>3/2,3/5,2 | low      |

The fundamental to the harmonics works as a drone.
