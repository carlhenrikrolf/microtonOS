# श्रुति (Shruti)

The 22 shruti in Indian music have been known since ancient times.
There have been various ways to calculate them and below is one just intonation (5-limit tuning) and one equal temperament (53edo).
Although, 22 by far seems the most common number, sometimes more shrutis than 22 are considered.
Note that there are three different step sizes, in 53edo: 1, 3, and 4.

| ratio   | factorisation                   | 53edo | 
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1       | $1$                             | 0     | 
| 256/243 | $2^{8}\times3^{-5}$             | 4     | 
| 16/15   | $2^{4}\times3^{-1}\times5^{-1}$ | 5     |
| 10/9    | $2^{1}\times3^{-2}\times5^{1}$  | 8     | 
| 9/8     | $2^{-3}\times3^{2}$             | 9     | 
| 32/27   | $2^{5}\times3^{-3}$             | 13    | 
| 6/5     | $2^{1}\times3^{1}\times5^{-1}$  | 14    | 
| 5/4     | $2^{-2}\times5^{1}$             | 17    | 
| 81/64   | $2^{-6}\times3^{4}$             | 18    | 
| 4/3     | $2^{2}\times3^{-1}$             | 22    | 
| 27/20   | $2^{-2}\times3^{3}\times5^{-1}$ | 23    | 
| 45/32   | $2^{-5}\times3^{2}\times5^{1}$  | 26    | 
| 64/45   | $2^{6}\times3^{-2}\times5^{-1}$ | 27    | 
| 3/2     | $2^{-1}\times3^{1}$             | 31    | 
| 128/81  | $2^{7}\times3^{-4}$             | 35    | 
| 8/5     | $2^{3}\times5^{-1}$             | 36    | 
| 5/3     | $3^{-1}\times5^{1}$             | 39    | 
| 27/16   | $2^{-4}\times3^{3}$             | 40    | 
| 16/9    | $2^{4}\times3^{-2}$             | 44    | 
| 9/5     | $3^{2}\times5^{-1}$             | 45    |
| 15/8    | $2^{-3}\times3^{1}\times5^{1}$  | 48    | 
| 243/128 | $2^{-7}\times3^{5}$             | 49    | 
| 2       | $2$                             | 53    |

41edo could also provide a rough approximation to the 22 shrutis.
Like 53edo, 41edo also has a very good approximation of the perfect fifth.
