**Pythagorean.**

**Harmonic.**

**Equal divisions.**

**Summary.**
Below, degree is the number of steps in an equal division. It does not matter precisely, but each degree is around 350¢/2=175¢. In other words, it's a kind of average between one and two semitones.

Note that susX replaces the major third with X, and symbols marked with \* also replace the major third. If a Pythagorean symbol is empty, it means that it's inherent. If a harmonic symbol is empty, it means that its not defined.

**old stuff**

A common way to analyse chords and chord progressions is through functional harmony.
Functional harmony is, however, difficult to generalise to other tuning systems.
Therefore, I first describe a simplified theory of harmony in 12edo, which I then generalise to any tuning system.

## Tension and Release in 12edo
Release chords (also known as consonant chords) sound good in isolation and often occur at the end of a song or section thereof.
Tension chords do not sound good on there own, but alternating between tension chord and release chords makes a song more interesting.

**Release.**
I define release chords as having five features: the root, the voice, fifths, octaves, and deletions.
For example, consider the chord A-7 (A-minor seventh, sometimes m is used instead of -).
The *root* (0 in any tuning system) is A---the lowest tone.
The *voice* is the minor third (3 in 12edo).
It is written as - in the chord symbol.
It can, however, be any other (ascending) interval and gives the chord its character.
*Fifths* (7 in 12 edo) can be added (ascending) to already present notes in the chord.
Adding a fifth above the root is so common it is not even notated.
(Am7 without the fifth could be written as A-7(no5).)
The minor seventh (10 in 12edo) is a fifth above the minot third. 
It is written as 7 in the chord symbol.
A fifth can be added to the fifth to form an A-9 and/or to the seventh to form an A-11.
Adding 11 fifths to the root would mean using all 12 tones of 12edo, which would be difficult to call a release chord.
How many fifths that can be added vary according to personally tastes and musical styles, see the table below.
|style     |voices (in 12edo)|fifths (number of)|
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
|rock, metal, many traditional musics|7|0|
|pop, hip hop, European classical music, and many more|3,4,5|1 to 2|
|jazz, RnB|2,3,4,5|2 to 5|
|flamenco|2,3,4,5|1 to 6|
|salsa, tango|8,9|2 to 3|
|12-tone music|any|unlimited|

*Octaves* (12 in 12edo) can be added (ascending or, as long as the root is the lowest, descending) to already present nnnotes in the chord.
If the note is duplicated across octaves, it can be *deleted*.
Otherwise, deletion will still keep the chord as a release chord but its charcter may change.

**Tension.**
A tension chord is any chord that is not a release chord.
For example, E7b9b13 is a tension chord for all styles except 12-tone music.
The major third (4 in 12edo, implicit in the notation) has the major 7th (11 in 12edo) a fifth above---not the minor seventh.
The flat ninth (13 in 12edo) would be acceptable for a release chord in flamenco as it is one octave below the sharp fifteenth (25 in 12edo), but otherwise not.
A natural thirteenth (21 in 12edo) would be acceptable in a release chord, but not a flat thirteenth (20 in 12edo).

## Progressions in 12edo
There are four common types of chord progressions that can be combined in different ways: scale steps, planing, descending fifths, common notes.

**Scale steps.**
In scale steps, chord notes are picked from the scale to form the first chord.
In the second chord, each note is either moved up or down one scale step.
This can be repeated.
Descending is more common as exemplified in different versions of the Andalusian cadence: Am, G, F, Em.

**Planing.**
In planing, the all the notes in the second chord have been moved by the same amount.
The amount can be any amount, but 1,2, or 3 steps in 12edo are common, for example: Dmaj7, Fmaj7, Emaj7, Ebmaj7.

**Descending fifths.**
In descending fifths, the roots either descend by a fifth or ascend by a fourth (5 in 12edo).
An example is the II-V-I progression, for example: Bbm7, Eb13, Db69.
A progression can be both planing and descending fifth at the same time.

**Common notes.**
In common notes (also known as connecting notes), the second chord shares at least one note with the first.
An example is tritone substitution/half Andalusian cadence, for example: F7#9#11, E(b9).
Another common example is any progression where the root does not change but other notes do.

## Generalising to any Tuning
Generalising release chords to other tuning systems is straight-forward if the tuning system has good approximations of fifths and octaves.
Also note that for n-edo, the number of fifths that can be added increases with n.
If the tuning has poor approximations of the fifths, you can remove that rule.
Similarly for tunings with poor approximations of the octave.
If both the fifth and the octave are poorly approximated, harmony according to these principles will become very difficult.
For such tunings, another theory would be preferable.
For such tunings, consider using the harmonic series just intonation, on which there are ample resources elsewhere.
Generalising tension chords is trivial ...

Generalising progressions is easy by using scale steps.
It is especially easy when the notes are mapped to a traditional piano (Halberstadt) layout.
I wonder if that is why descending scale steps are so common in contemporary Middle Eastern and Indian musics.
(Note that Middle Eastern and Indian classical musics do not use harmony apart from parallel octaves and bass drone notes.)
Planing is easy if the tuning has steps of equal size, such as an edo, ed3/2, etc.
It is especially easy if notes are mapped to an isomorpic keyboard layout.
For unequal tunings, more care must be taken and planing may not even be possible.
Descending fifths is possible if both fifths and octaves are well approximated.
Note that if both the fifth and the octave are well approximated, then the fouth will also be.
Generalising common notes is trivial!
