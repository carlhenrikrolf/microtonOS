## Repetition legitimises

Below, degree is the number of steps in an equal division. It does not matter precisely, but each degree is around 350¢/2=175¢. In other words, it's a kind of average between one and two semitones.

Note that susX replaces the major third with X, and symbols marked with \* also replace the major third. If a Pythagorean symbol is empty, it means that it's inherent. If a harmonic symbol is empty, it means that its not defined.
