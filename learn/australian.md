Australian aboriginal music is traditionally centered around singing in groups.
Singing is mostly unison with the exception being singing in octaves.
Accompaniment is percussive with clapping hands, thighs, and sticks.
Boomerangs can also be used as instruments.
The only tonal instrument is the didjeridu, which plays a drone, but it is not used by all aboriginal societies.
There doesn't seem to be many words describing music theoretical concepts.
Nonetheless, the notes are highly ordered.
Making sense of this order as an outsider is very difficult and the scales below are bound to be inaccurate.


|       | 6ed3/2 | 10Hz steps |
|-------|--------|------------|
| cents | 0,117,234,<br />351,468,585,<br />702,819,939,1053,1170 | 0,111,215,<br />314,402,495<br />579,659,736,809 |
| Hz    | 151,162,173,<br />185,198,212<br />226,242,259,277 | 151,161,171,<br />181,191,201,<br />211,221,231,241 |

Many more notes separated by very small intervals are used, but the scales above include the more important notes.
At least among the Pitjantjatjara, there does seem to be a 10Hz period between used notes.
Intervals of 1 or 3 steps in 6ed3/2 seem particularly prominent.
Apart from the tonic, melodies dwell on the fourth and the fifth above.
