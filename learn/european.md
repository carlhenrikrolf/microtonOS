# European Classical Music

Early European music was heavily influenced by [Greek music](greek.md) and instruments such as organs, harps, and bagpipes were common.
During medieval times, Arabic influences grew and instruments such as violins and guitars and other lutes were introduced.
Towards the end of the medieval times, Europeans combined the keys of the organ (of Greek origin) with the strings of the qanun (a zither of Arabic origin) to build first clavichords and harpsichords, and, later, pianos.
During this time, Europeans experimented with many different tuning systems including the independent development of 12edo.
Mean-tone tuning systems were another class of tunings that was common before 12edo became dominant.
1/3 mean-tone tuning is well-approximated by 19edo and 1/4 mean-tone tuning by 31edo.

The parenthetical notes are played when there is a descending motion.
The harmonic minor and Neapolitan minor scales are modulations associated with certain chords.
