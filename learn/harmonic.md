# Harmonic Series

In acoustics, you get a harmonic series by starting at an arbitrary frequency $f$ for the first harmonic.
Then, the second harmonic is $2f$, the third is $3f$ and so on.
In other words, it's a kind of an equal Hz steps tuning, where the bottom frequency has the same value as the step size.
This series is the same that you get by playing flageolets on a guitar string, guqin string, or any other kind of tuned string.
Musically, it can be useful to consider the octaves as equivalent and move the notes in the harmonic series into one octave.
Several equal divisions of the octave and other intervals have been proposed to approximate this kind of *octave-reduced* harmonic series.
