Tuning is consistent within an ensemble (gamelan, degung, kulintang), but may vary greatly between different Indonesian islands.
Furthermore, it varies between ensembles on the same islands, as is clear from the difference between Eastern and Western Java.
Instrumentation is more consistent—dominated by bronze percussion instruments such as gongs and vibraphone-like instruments.

**Javanese (Eastern).**
The Javanese people are concentrated on Eastern and central Java.
There are two different tuning systems.

<table>
<tr>
<td>ꦱ꧀ꦭꦺꦤ꧀ꦢꦿꦺꦴ <br /> (sléndro)</td><td>1,2, <br /> 3,4,5</td><td>5edo</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ꦥꦺꦭꦺꦴꦒ꧀ <br /> (pélog)</td><td>1,2,4, <br /> 5,6,8,9 </td><td>9edo</td>
</tr>
</table>


The scales from both tuning systems use five notes.
In the case of sléndro, all of the notes are used.
In the case of pélog different 5-note subsets are used.

|       |9edo|12edo|
|-------|----|-----|
|pélog bem | 1,4, <br /> 5,6,9 | 1,6, <br /> 7,8,12 |
|pélog barang | 1,4, <br /> 5,7,9 | 1,6, <br /> 7,9,12 |
|pélog selisir | 1,2, <br /> 5,6,9 | 1,3, <br /> 7,8,12 |
|pélog tembung | 1,2, <br /> 5,6,9 | 1,2, <br /> 6,7,12 |
|pélog sunaren | 1,3, <br /> 5,6,9 | 1,3, <br /> 6,9,12 |
|pélog baro | 2,3, <br /> 4,7,9 | 3,4, <br /> 5,9,12 |

Note that pélog tunings vary greatly and both 9edo and 12edo fall within that variation.

**Balinese.**
In Balinese gamelan, there is a particular tuning concept known as ombak.
In ombak, each instrument in the ensemble comes in pairs.
One instrument in the pair is tuned lower than the other.
The lower tuning is called pengumbang and the higher tuning is called pengisep.
For each tone, the instruments are tuned a fixed number of Hertz apart—usually less than 15 Hz.
This results in inference beating when the instruments play the note.
Furthermore, at least one of the instruments will necessarily lack perfectly tuned octaves.
There are 5 different kinds of ombak tuning:
- Pengisep has perfect octaves, but each tone of the pengumbang is tuned x Hz lower.
- Pengumbang has perfect octaves, but each tone of the pengisep is tuned x Hz higher.
- Pengisep one octave up is a perfectly tuned octave from pengumbang.
- Pengumbang one octave up is a perfectly tuned octave from pengisep.
- Neither has perfect octaves. Pengisep is tuned x/2 Hz up from a perfect-octave tuning. Pengumbang is tuned x/2 Hz down.

**Sundanese (Western).**
The Sundanese people are concentrated on Western Java.

There are two variants of sléndro (known as salendro in Sundanese).
Salendro pedantara is identical to Javanese sléndro.
Once again, pélog can vary greatly, and the 9edo and 12edo tunings above could be used here as well.
As before 5-note subsets of pélog are used as scales.

|    | 16edo |
|----|-------|
| jawar | 2,4, <br /> 9,11,16 | 
| liwung | 2,7, <br /> 9,11,16 |
| sorog | 2,7, <br /> 9,11,16 |

There are also additional scales for the solo instrument, which can be either a sulintang (a kind of flute) or a rebab (a kind of spike fiddle).
When the xylophones and vibraphone-like instruments are playing in salendro pedanatara, the solo instrument can play in one of two different scales.

|    | 15edo |
|----|-------|
|mataraman | 5,6, <br /> 11,12,15 |
|madenda | 1,3, <br /> 7,14,15 |

Mataraman and madenda can further be played in different modes.

|    |    | mode |
|----|----|------|
|mataraman | madenda | 0 |
|degung dwi suara | wisaya | 3 |
|degung tri suara | | 4 |
