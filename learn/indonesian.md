There are three main variants: Sundanese, Javenese, and Balinese gamelan.
Sundanese gamelan is also known as degung.
Tuning is consistent within one ensemble (called gamelan as well).
However, it can vary greatly between different ensembles.

Ombak and octave-stretching/compression.
In Balinese gamelan, there is a particular tuning concept known as ombak.
In ombak, each instrument in the ensemble comes in pairs.
One instrument in the pair is tuned lower than the other.
The lower tuning is called pengumbang and the higher tuning is called pengisep.
For each tone, the instruments are tuned a fixed number of Hertz apart---usually less than 15 Hz.
This results in inference beating when the instruments play the note.
Furthermore, at least one of the instruments will necessarily lack perfectly tuned octaves.
There are 5 different kinds of ombak tuning:
- Pengisep has perfect octaves, but each tone of the pengumbang is tuned x Hz lower.
- Pengumbang has perfect octaves, but each tone of the pengisep is tuned x Hz higher.
- Pengisep one octave up is a perfectly tuned octave from pengumbang.
- Pengumbang one octave up is a perfectly tuned octave from pengisep.
- Neither has perfect octaves. Pengisep is tuned x/2 Hz up from a perfect-octave tuning. Pengumbang is tuned x/2 Hz down.
