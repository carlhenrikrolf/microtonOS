There are three main variants: Sundanese, Javenese, and Balinese gamelan.
Sundanese gamelan is also known as degung.
Tuning is consistent within one ensemble (called gamelan as well).
However, it can vary greatly between different ensembles.

In Balinese gamelan, there is a particular tuning concept known as ombak.
In ombak, each instrument in the ensemble comes in pairs.
One of the instrument is detuned a fixed number of Hertz for for each tone.
This results in inference beating when the instruments play the same melody.
The detuning is usually less than 15 Hertz.
Detuning the second instrument lower than the first results in stretched octaves for the second instrument.
Detuning the second instrument higher than the first results in compressed octaves for the second instrument.
Approximating the resulting total tuning as an equal step tuning is not possible.
