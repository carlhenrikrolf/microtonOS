Instruments in Georgian music include
the harp ჩანგი (changi),
the guitar-like ჩონგური (chonguri),
the bagpipe გუდასტვირი (gudastviri), and 
the flute სალამური (salamuri).
Nonetheless, chanting is the most prominent part of Georgian music.

|        | 4ed3/2 | 8ed4/3 | 20ed3/2 |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
|"major" | 1,2,3,4| | 5(6),10,15,20 |
|"minor" | | 3,5,8,11 | 5(6),9,15,20 |

The scales are repeated on the perfect fifth, or, ins some cases and regions on the perfect fourth.
In other words, the fifth or the fourth takes the equivalence function that the octave often has.
Parentheses indicate notes that are sometimes used vertically (in a chord) but not horizontally (in a melodic line).

> **Chords.**

> A common kind of triad in Georgian music is the sus4 chord.
