Chanting is a prominent part of Georgian music.
Harmony is often in fourths and fifths.

|        | 4ed3/2 | 20ed3/2 |
|--------|--------|---------|
|"major" | 1,2,3,4| 5,10,15,20 |
|"minor" | (indistinguishable)|5,9,15,20 |

The scales are repeated on the perfect fith.
In other words, the fifth is the equave.
