Music in Korea and Vietnam is closely related to Chinese music.
Musics in Japan and central Asia have been influenced by it.
Common instruments include zithers such as the guqin or the guzheng as well as spike fiddles such as the erhu.
[Pythagorean tuning](pythagorean.md) was independently developed in China.
Furthermore, using 12edo to temper it was also developed independently.
However, it only reached wide usage after increased contact with Europeans.
A number of other suggestions were also proposed such as 53-tone, 60-tone, and 360-tone systems.
Below, fan yin and an yin are specific to the guqin, whereas gong is a general musical scale.

<table>
<tr><td>宮 (gong)</td><td>2,4,<br />7,9,12</td><td>12edo</td></tr>
<tr><td>泛音 (fan yin)</td><td>2,5*,3,4,<br />5,6,8</td><td>just</td></tr>
<tr><td>按音 (an yin)</td><td>8/7,6/5,5/4<br />3/4,2/3,5/3,2</td><td>just</td></tr>
</table>

As mentioned, the guqin is a zither.
String positions are marked with dots known as 徽 (hui).
Starting from the middle of the string and going to the end, 7 huis are marked.
These are mirrored along the other direction making 13 in total.
The fan yin technique is equivalent to playing flageolets on the positions of the huis.
Each hui corresponds to a harmonic (\* the fifth harmonic occurs twice on each side of the guqin).
The harmonics increase in pitch starting from the middle and going to the side.
The an yin technique is equivalent to pinching the strings.
Following the huis from the side to the middle this leads to an increasing pitch.
However, an yin is not necessarily performed on the huis.
Often the string is stopped on locations in between approximating a gong scale.
The gong scale has several modes named below.


|           | mode |
| --------- | ---- |
| 宮 (gong)  | 0    |
| 商 (shang) | 1    |
| 角 (jue)   | 2    |
| 徵 (zhi)   | 3    |
| 羽 (yu)    | 4    |
