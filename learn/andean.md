Modern American music have strong influences from Europe and Africa, whereas the native American influences are considerably less noticeable.
Some instruments such as güiras, maracas, and certain flutes have been preserved since pre-Columbian times.
However, when it comes to tuning, European 12edo is dominant.
Therefore, I provide some ancient tunings, namely tunings measured from panpipes from the Nasca culture, that thrived in the Andes between 400 BC and 600 AD.

|     | 7edo | 43Hz steps |
|-----|------|------------|
|steps| 0, 2, 3, 4, (5,) 6, 7 | 0, 1, 2, 3, (4,) 5, 6
|cents| -37, 305, 477, 649, 820, (991,) 1162 | 0, 244, 458, 648, 820, (976,) 1119 |
|Hz   | 277, 338, 374, 413, 456, (503,) 556 | 284, 327, 370, 413, 456, (499,) 542 |

One theory is that the panpipes were intended to be tuned in 7edo with two notes removed forming a pentatonic scale.
We know that contemporary Andean music uses pentatonic scales for panpipes, and many cultures around the use and have used 7edo.
The parentheses indicate a note to remove to form a pentatonic scale.
The reason why it is part of the panpipe could, e.g., be for uses of modulation

Another theory is that the the panpipes were intended to be tuned 43Hz apart.
Equal steps in frequencies imply that all steps are unequal in cents
Therefore, it is an octaveless scale.
