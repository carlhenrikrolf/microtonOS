**Secular.**
Scales in secular ethiopian music are know as ቅኝት (qenet, kignit, and various other spellings).
Three of the scales come in two variants, similar to a major and a minor variant.

| 12edo   | "major" | "minor"|
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| አንቺ ሆዬ (anchi hoye) | 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 | 1, 5, 6, 9, 12 |
| አምባሰል (ambessel) | 2, 5, 7, 9, 12 | 1, 5, 7, 8, 12 | 
| ባቲ (bati) | 4, 5, 7, 11, 12 | 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 |
| ትዝታ (tezita) | 2, 4, 7, 8, 12 | 2, 3, 7, 8, 12 |

Note that ambessel "major" is an unusual scale (and sometimes thought of as a variant of anchi hoye instead).
There are numerous further variations.
For instance, the third, fourth, and fifth degress of bati may be raised.
