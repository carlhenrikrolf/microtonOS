Common instruments in Ethiopian music involves harps such as the ክራር (krar) and the በገና (begena)
as well as spike fiddles such as the ማሲንቆ (mesenqo)
Traditional musicians are known as አዝማሪ (azmari).

**Secular.**
Scales in secular ethiopian music are know as ቅኝት (qenet, kignit, and various other spellings).
Three of the scales come in two variants, similar to a major and a minor variant.

| 12edo   | "major" | "minor"|
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| አንቺ ሆዬ <br /> (anchi hoye) | 3,6, <br /> 7,10,12 | 1,5, <br /> 6,9,12 |
| አምባሰል <br /> (ambessel) | 2,5, <br /> 7,9,12 | 1,5, <br /> 7,8,12 | 
| ባቲ <br /> (bati) | 4,5, <br /> 7,11,12 | 3,5, <br /> 7,10,12 |
| ትዝታ <br /> (tezita) | 2,4, <br /> 7,8,12 | 2,3, <br /> 7,8,12 |

Note that ambessel "major" is an unusual scale (and sometimes thought of as a variant of anchi hoye instead).
There are numerous further variations.
For instance, the third, fourth, and fifth degress of bati may be raised.

**Christian.**
Christian music uses three scales (zema) related to the three parts of the holy trinity.
Each scale, however, can vary considerably in its tuning.
