Burmese music frequently use instruments such as the pattala (a kind of xylophone) and the saung gauk (a kind of harp).
The tuning of these instruments can vary widely, but below are two suggestions on how to tune the four most common scales.

|              | 17edo | 24edo |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| ည့င်လုံ (hyin loun) | 5, 7, 10, 15, 17 | 7, 10, 14, 21, 24 |
| မြ၌င် (myin zaing)   | 3, 6, 10, 13, 17 | 4, 8, 14, 18, 24 |
| ဩကပြန် (auk pyan)    | 5, 8, 10, 15, 17 | 7, 11, 14, 21, 24 |
| ပုလဲ (pale)   | 3, 5, 10, 13, 17 | 4, 7, 14, 18, 24 |

Note that there are several additional scales that vary only slightly from these.
