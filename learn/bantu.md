Bantu peoples discovered iron-manufacturing independently of Eurasia, and then spread from somewhere in the Cameroon area to much of subsaharan Africa.
Common instruments are indeed made of iron such as thumb pianos and bells.
However, vibraphones are rare whereas xylophones are common.
Although subsaharan Africa is diverse, most countries in the region today have a Bantu majority.

Mwànjo means octave in Baganda rather than being a name of a scale or tuning.
Uganda and Zimbabwe are taken as examples here, but 5edo and 7edo tunings can approximate many tunings of subsaharan Africa.
Tuning tends to be highly unstandardised, so 7edo and 5edo prove useful median tunings.

> Harmony in parallel major thirds is common and easy to play on a xylophone tuned near 7edo or 5edo.

It is difficult to speak of modes when all notes in the scale are at an equal distance, but could be done for some of the 6-tone and 5-tone subsets of 7edo.
It can also be done for dambatsoko similarly to European or Indian scales.

|     | mode |
|-----|------|
|dambatsoko | 0 |
|katsanzaira| 1 |
|mavembe, gandanga, nemakonde | 2 |
|nyamaropa, dongonda | 4 |

The Shona word katsanzaira has the rather poetic meaning 'the gentle rain before the storm comes'.
