# Romani Traditional Music

During medieval times, the Romani migrated from India to the Middle East and then Europe.
Along the way, they mixed their different influences such as Indian rhythms, Middle-Eastern scales and European chords.
Today their musics are national symbols for countries such as Spain, Hungary, and Romania (the words Romani and Romania only sound similar by coincidence and have different origins).
Common instruments include guitars (Spain and French-speaking Europe) and zithers, and accordions (Balkan) and violins.
