12edo was independently discovered by Zhu Zaiyu in China.

Chinese|Japanese|12edo|

| gong  |ryo  | 2, 4, 7, 9, 12 |
|(not used) | in(sen)| 1, 5, 7, 8, 12   |

|shi'er l√º| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 | 5, 9, 14, 18, 23, 27, 31, 36, 40, 45, 49, 53 |
|Han era | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |  4, 9, 14, 17, 22, 27, 31, 35, 40, 45, 49, 53 |
|400s | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12     | 4, 9, 13, 17, 22, 26, 31, 35, 40, 44, 48, 53 |

The latter two may be better approximated with 60edo, but that is beyond scope.
