By Eastern Asia, I mean China and Japan.
Vietnamese, Korean, and Mongolian music share many similarities.
Common instruments include zithers such as the guqin or the guzheng as well as spike fiddles such as the erhu.
[Pythagorean tuning](pythagorean.md) was independently developed in China.
Furthermore, using 12edo to temper it was also developed independently.
However, it only reached wide usage after increased contact with Europeans.
A number of other suggestions were also proposed such as 53-tone, 60-tone, and 360-tone systems.

Chinese|Japanese|12edo|24edo|
|------|----|-----|---|
| gong  |ryo  | 2, 4, <br> 7, 9, 12 | 4, 8, 14, <br /> 18, 24 |
|(not used) | in(sen)| 1, 5, <br />7, 8, 12   | 2(1), 10, <br /> 14, 16(15), 24

The parenthetical notes are used in a downward motions while playing a kind of flute known as the shakuhachi.
A number of different modes have been named.

|Chinese | Japan | -ese |mode|
|-----|----|----|---|
| 宮 (gong) | ryo |in(sen)| 0  |
| 商 (shang) |   |     | 1 |
| 角 (jue) |    |hirajoshi| 2|
| 徵 (zhi) | yo, ritsu |iwato|3|
| 羽 (yu) | minyo |     |4|
