# American Urban Music

American music has strong influences from the European colonisers and the African slaves, whereas the native American influences are considerably more subtle.
This is true both of North and South America.
In terms of tuning, it is almost entirely European, i.e. 12edo.
Unlike European music drums and other forms of percussion are omnipresent.
Guitars, pianos, accordions, and trumpets are other common instruments.
The scales are a fusion of European and African influences.


|    |12edo|
|----|-----|
|major|2,4,5, <br /> 7,9,11,12|
|melodic minor|2,4,5, <br /> 7,9,11,12|
|harmonic minor|2,3,5, <br /> 7,8,11,12|
|blues major|3*,4,7, <br /> 9,10,12|
|blues minor|3*,5,6, <br /> 7,10,12|
|bebop major| 2,4,5,7, <br />  8,9,11,12 |
|bebop melodic minor| 2,3,5,7, <br /> 8,9,11,12 |
|bebop (harmonic) minor| 2,3,5,7, <br /> 8,10,11,12 |
|bebop dominant| 2,4,5,7, <br /> 9,10,11,12 |

The notes marked with * are sometimes lowered by a quartertone.
The blues major can have many different forms and this is just one possible example.
Note that, in jazz, the melodic minor is the same both ascending and descending unlike in European classical music.
There is an abundance of scales with even number of notes.
The purpose of this in the bebop scales is that chord tones (built from every other scale note) should end up on the strong beats when ascending or descending.
More southern styles, e.g. salsa, samba, and tango, rely more on the 7-note scales.
Brazilian forró music (baião) may use more uncommon modes thereof.

> **Chords**
>
> Blues music typically takes a dominant 7 chord and moves it around on the positions I7, IV7, and V7.
> Unlike European classical music the dominant 7 chord is considered a stable chord in blues, possibly an African influence.
> Jazz draws more closely on European classical music, but the IIm,V7,I can be replaced for a IIm7,&flat;7,Imaj7 and the IIm7&flat;5,&flat;II7,Im7.
> Note the *tritone* substitution of V7 to &flat;II7 and the 4-note chords.
> Indeed, chords may have many more chords by stacking different thirds to the &flat;9, 9, &sharp;9, 11, &sharp;11, &flat;13, and 13 extensions.
> Salsa and tango frequently make use of the progression V7&flat;9,Iadd&flat;6.
