# West-Sahelian Classical Music

The western Sahel region was part of the Malian empire (the Mandinka empire) in the middle ages.
Apart from Mali, it also covered what is now Burkina Faso, Senegal, Gambia, and parts of the Ivory Coast.
In that empire there was a caste of musicians called ߖߋ߬ߟߌ (jeli), who developed the classical music of the region.
Noteable instruments include the harp-like ߤߐߙߊ (kora), the guitar-like (banjo-like) ߣߤߐ߬ߣߌ߲ (ngoni), the xylophone ߕߊߟߊ (bala), and the goblet drum ߖߍ߲ߓߋ (djembe).

[^tomoraba]: Tomoraba is known under many names in Manding: silaba, silakoi, dumo, kumbemba, and balabengo. Balabengo means bala tuning, but it is different from the equiheptatonic tuning often used for the bala.

The tunings are known as kombengulo (sg. kombengo).
Tomoraba is considered the original kora tuning.
Tomora misengo, hardino, and sauta are ways to tune the kora adapted from other instruments such as the ngoni.
The bala is tuned differently, roughly to 7edo
(in 41edo we can maintain the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth, but in 53edo they are lightly closer).
Nonetheless, kora and balafon can be played together.
Tomoraba is common in western Gambia and Casamance, tomora mesengo and hardino in eastern Gambia, and sauta in Mali.
