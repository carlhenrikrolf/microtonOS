# Just Intonation

Just intonation is tuning based on rational numbers ($3/2$, $5/4$, etc.).
This is different from equal step tunings which are based on irrational numbers ($2^{1/12}$, $(3/2)^{1/9}$, etc.).
An early approach to tuning, which is common to several cultures, was Pythagorean tuning.
In Pythagorean tuning, a twelve-note unequal tuning is constructed using $2$ and $3$ as factors.
$2$ corresponds to the first harmonic, that you get by halfing a string on a string instrument.
$3$ correspond to the second harmonic, that you get by dividing the string in a third.
Both of these harmonics tend to be prominent as overtones on string instruments.
Below are some important just intervals.

|name |factorisation |ratio |
|-----|--------------|------|
|perfect octave| $2$ | $2$ |
|harmonic seventh | $2^{-2}\times7$ | $7/4$ |
|just perfect fifth | $2^{-1}\times3$ | $3/2$ |
|just perfect fourth | $2^{2}\times3^{-1}$ | $4/3$ |
|Pythagorean major third | $2^{-6}\times3^{4}$ | $81/64$ |
|just major third | $2^{-2}\times5$ | $5/4$ |
|just minor third | $2\times3\times5^{-1}$ | $6/5$ |
|Pythagorean minor third | $2^{5}\times3^{-3}$ | $32/27$ |

A justly tuned pentatonic major scale can be constructed by alternating between going up a perfect fifth and going down a perfect fourth until you get 5 tones.
A justly tuned lydian (major #4) scale can be constructed by doing this until you get 7 tones.
If you do this until you get 13 tones, the thirteenth tone is almost but not quite equal to the octave.
12edo can be seen as a compromise using perfect octaves and *almost* perfect fifths ($2^{7/12}$).
By doing this until you get 54, the 54th note is much closer to the octave, which is why 53edo serves as a very good alternative with the drawback that 53 is a large number.
