# Indian Classical Music

Indian classical music comprises two traditions: Hindustani classical music from the North and Carnatic classical music from the south.
Both traditions pick notes to their scales from a set of 22 pitch intervals.
The ends of the intervals are known as [shrutis](shruti.md).
The 22 shrutis are very well-approximated by 53edo.

|     |53edo|
|-----|-----|
| श्रुति (shruti) | 4,5;8,9;13,14;17,18;22,23;26,27; <br /> 31;35,36;39,40;44,45;48,49;53 |

Some common instruments, in particular the harmonium–an indianised variant of the European harmonium, do not distinguish between shrutis but uses 12edo.
12edo pitches fall in between shruti intervals and approximate the perfect fifth well.
String instruments are prominent and have a longer tradition.
Instruments such as veena, sitar, and tambura have a very characteristic sound due to their many resonant strings, which are partially dampened to produce an evolving timbre.
The tabla is a common type of drum and as with all Indian instruments should not be confused with Middle Eastern instruments with similar names.

The modes in Indian music are known as ragas, of which there are many.
In Hindustani music, they are categorised into *thaats* and, in Carnatic music, they are categorised into *melakartas*.
Ragas may differ from thaats and melakartas in that:
- They only use a 5 or 6-note subset of the 7 notes.
- They look different when ascending or descending, e.g., by using different subsets in different directions. Trills can also look different when ascending or descending.
- The prominent notes (apart from the root), the *vadi* and *samvadi* may differ.

**Hindustani (Northern).**
Hindustani music have a stronger Iranian influence.
Indeed, Hindustan is the Persian name for India.
There are 10 thaats—scales that are particularly prominent.

|       |53edo |12edo |
|-------|------|------|
| बिलावल ठाट <br /> (bilaval thaat)| 9,17,22, <br /> 31,39,48,53 | 2,4,5, <br /> 7,9,11,12 |
| भैरव ठाट <br /> (bhairav thaat)|5,17,22,<br />  31,36,48,53 | 1,4,5,<br />  7,8,11,12 |
| पूर्वी ठाट <br /> (poorvi thaat)| 5,17,26, <br /> 31,35,48,53 | 1,4,6,<br />  7,8,11,12 |
| मारवा ठाट <br /> (marva thaat)| 5,14,26,<br />  31,40,48,53 | 1,4,6, <br /> 7,9,11,12 |
| तोड़ी ठाट <br /> (todi thaat) | 4,13,26,<br />  31,35,48,53 | 1,3,6,<br />  7,8,11,12 |

The exact choice of shrutis can vary somewhat. For example, raga darbari is a member of thaat asavari, where 14 is replaced by 13. The 53edo representations of the thaats have been derived from the ragas that named them.

|       |mode|
|-------|----|
|बिलावल ठाट <br />(bilaval thaat) | 0 |
|काफ़ी ठाट <br />(kafi thaat) | 1 |
|भैरवी ठाट <br />(bhairavi thaat) | 2 |
|कल्याण ठाट <br />(kalyan thaat, yaman thaat) | 3 |
|खमाज ठाट <br />(khamaj thaat) | 4 |
|आशवरी ठाट <br />(asavari thaat)| 5 |

Note that thaats bhairav and bharavi are different.

List of ragas.

The list below is from [22shruti.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20250113154440/https://22shruti.com/research_topic_53.asp).
The translation of the notation to 53edo is as follows:

S=0,
r1=4,
r2=5,
R1=8,
R2=9,
g1=17,
g2=18,
M1=22,
M2=23,
m1=26,
m2=27,
P=31,
d1=35,
d2=36,
D1=39,
D2=40,
n1=44,
n2=45,
N1=48,
N2=49

Note that in many other sources, M and m are reversed.
Furthermore, the numbers should not be confused with the numbering system in South Indian music.
The scales of the raga are given under "swaras" ("raga scale" is only a subset)
These tunings are not absolute.
For example, marva raga (transliterated as marawa raga below) has the note m1=22 below, however, other sources treats it as m2=23 instead.

**Carnatic (Southern).**
Carnatic refers to the state Karnataka in Southern India, but the area for Carnatic music extends to other states in Southern India, and the language used to teach Carnatic music is Telegu.
The equivalent to thaat in Carnatic music is known as melakarta.
Rather than selecting a few prominent scales, listing the melakartas is a combinatorial exercise leading to the large number of 72 melakartas.
To make them more managable they are grouped into 12 chakras.
A chakra is the set of melakartas with the same bottom four notes.

| perfect fourth (5) | sharp fourth (6) | 12edo |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| చంద్ర చక్రా <br /> (indu chakra) | ఋషి చక్రా <br />rishi chakra | 1,2,5(6) |
| నేత్రా చక్రా <br />netra chakra | వాసు చక్రా <br />vasu chakra | 1,3,5(6) |
| అగ్ని చక్రా <br />agni chakra | బ్రహ్మ చక్రా <br />brahma chakra | 1,4,5(6) |
| వేదాలు చక్రా <br />vedas chakra | దిశ చక్రా <br />disi chakra | 2,3,5(6) |
| బాణా చక్రా <br />bana chakra | రుద్ర చక్రా <br />rudra chakra | 2,4,5(6) |
| రుతు చక్రా <br />rutu chakra | ఆదిత్యులు చక్రా <br />adityas chakra | 3,4,5(6) |

The parenthesis is used for the sharp fourth.
The melakartas are formed by taking one of the 12 chakras and combining it with one of the 6 chakras with perfect fourth to get an octave-spanning scale.
