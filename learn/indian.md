# Indian Classical Music

Indian classical music comprises two traditions: Hindustani classical music from the North and Carnatic classical music from the south.
Both traditions pick notes to their scales from a set of 22 pitch intervals.
The ends of the intervals are known as shrutis.
Hindustani scales are known as thaat.
Note that some common instruments, like the harmonium of European origin, do use 12edo.



|       |53edo |12edo |
|-------|------|------|
| श्रुति (shruti) |4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23, 26, 27, 31, 35, 36, 39, 40, 44, 45, 48, 49, 53 | (not meaningful) |
| बिलावल ठाट (bilaval thaat)| 9, 17, 22, 31, 39, 48, 53 | 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 |
| भैरव ठाट (bhairav thaat)|5, 17, 22, 31, 36, 48, 53 | 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12 |
| पूर्वी ठाट (poorvi thaat)| 5, 17, 26, 31, 35, 48, 53 | 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 |
| मारवा ठाट (marva thaat)| 5, 14, 26, 31, 40, 48, 53 | 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 |
| तोड़ी ठाट (todi thaat) | 4, 13, 26, 31, 35, 48, 53 | 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 |

> [!warning]
> The exact choice of shrutis can vary somewhat. For example, raga darbari is a member of thaat asavari, where 14 is replaced by 13. The 53edo representations of the thaats have been derived from the ragas that named them.

|       |mode|
|-------|----|
|बिलावल ठाट (bilaval thaat) | 0 |
|काफ़ी ठाट (kafi thaat) | 1 |
|भैरवी ठाट (bhairavi thaat) | 2 |
|कल्याण ठाट (kalyan thaat, yaman thaat) | 3 |
|खमाज ठाट (khamaj thaat) | 4 |
|आशवरी ठाट (asavari thaat)| 5 |

Note that thaats bhairav and bharavi are different.




The equivalent to thaat in Carnatic music is known as melakarta. 
However, every possible way to pick 7 different notes from a set of 12 notes is named as a melakarta.
If you want to reproduce an Indian sound, that is not very helpful, so I leave the melakarta system out.
