# Indian Classical Music

Indian classical music comprises two traditions: Hindustani classical music from the North and Carnatic classical music from the south.
Both traditions pick notes to their scales from a set of 22 pitch intervals.
The ends of the intervals are known as shrutis.
Hindustani scales are known as thaat.

Note that some common instruments, like the harmonium of European origin, do use 12edo.


|       |mode|
|-------|----|
|thaat bilaval | 0 |
|thaat kafi | 1 |
|thaat bhairavi | 2 |
|thaat kalyan (yaman) | 3 |
|thaat khamaj | 4 |
|thaat asavari| 5 |

Note that thaats bhairav and bharavi are different.

> [!warning]
> The exact choice of shrutis can vary somewhat. For example, raga darbari is a member of thaattt asavari, where 14 is replaced by 13.


The equivalent to thaat in Carnatic music is known as melakarta. 
However, every possible way to pick 7 different notes from a set of 12 notes is named as a melakarta.
If you want to reproduce an Indian sound, that is not very helpful, so I leave the melakarta system out.
