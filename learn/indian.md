# Indian Classical Music

Indian classical music comprises two traditions: Hindustani classical music from the North and Carnatic classical music from the south.
Both traditions pick notes to their scales from a set of 22 pitch intervals.
The ends of the intervals are known as [shrutis](shruti.md).
Note that some common instruments, like the harmonium of European origin, do use 12edo.

**Hindustani (Northern).**
Hindustani music have a stronger Iranian influence.
There are 10 *thaats*—scales that are particularly prominent.

|       |53edo |12edo |
|-------|------|------|
| बिलावल ठाट <br /> (bilaval thaat)| 9, 17, 22, <br /> 31, 39, 48, 53 | 2, 4, 5, <br /> 7, 9, 11, 12 |
| भैरव ठाट <br /> (bhairav thaat)|5, 17, 22,<br />  31, 36, 48, 53 | 1, 4, 5,<br />  7, 8, 11, 12 |
| पूर्वी ठाट <br /> (poorvi thaat)| 5, 17, 26, <br /> 31, 35, 48, 53 | 1, 4, 6,<br />  7, 8, 11, 12 |
| मारवा ठाट <br /> (marva thaat)| 5, 14, 26,<br />  31, 40, 48, 53 | 1, 4, 6, <br /> 7, 9, 11, 12 |
| तोड़ी ठाट <br /> (todi thaat) | 4, 13, 26,<br />  31, 35, 48, 53 | 1, 3, 6,<br />  7, 8, 11, 12 |

The exact choice of shrutis can vary somewhat. For example, raga darbari is a member of thaat asavari, where 14 is replaced by 13. The 53edo representations of the thaats have been derived from the ragas that named them.

|       |mode|
|-------|----|
|बिलावल ठाट (bilaval thaat) | 0 |
|काफ़ी ठाट (kafi thaat) | 1 |
|भैरवी ठाट (bhairavi thaat) | 2 |
|कल्याण ठाट (kalyan thaat, yaman thaat) | 3 |
|खमाज ठाट (khamaj thaat) | 4 |
|आशवरी ठाट (asavari thaat)| 5 |

Note that thaats bhairav and bharavi are different.

**Carnatic (Southern).**

The equivalent to thaat in Carnatic music is known as melakarta. 
However, every possible way to pick 7 different notes from a set of 12 notes is named as a melakarta.
If you want to reproduce an Indian sound, that is not very helpful, so I leave the melakarta system out.
