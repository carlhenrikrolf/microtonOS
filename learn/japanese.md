Japanese music has had a strong Chinese influence.
The zither 箏 (koto) is derived from the guzheng, the guitar-like 三味線 (shamisen) is derived from the sanxian, and the bamboo flute 尺八 (shakuhachi) is derived from the xiao for example.
The spike fiddle 胡弓 (kokyu) is reminiscent of the Chinese erhu but is derived from South-East Asian Rebab.
Unlike Chinese music, Japanese music makes use of hemipentatonic scales.

The parenthetical notes are used in a downward motions while playing a kind of flute known as the shakuhachi.
A number of different modes have been named.
