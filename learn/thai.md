Cambodian and Laotian musics are similar to Thai music, but other cultures in South-East Asia are notably different.
Xylophones are tuned in 7edo.

|              | 7edo |
|--------------|------|
| "ไทย (Thai)" | 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 |
| "มอญ (Mon)"  | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |

There are 5 modes of the "Thai scale" both in theory and in practice.
It has been argued that 11ed3 would be a better approximation than 7edo as it accounts for a slight octave-stretching of 10 cents.
