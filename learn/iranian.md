# Iranian Classical Music

The medieval musician and theorist Safi al-Din al-Urmawi developed a 17-tone system.
That system did not have equally spaced note, but to an approximation 17edo can be used.
Notes in a scale can have many different functions; the *finalis* is interpreted as the root.

Avaz bayat-e-esfahan is a mode of dastgah homayun.
Dastgah rast-panjgah is a transposition of dastgah mahur.
Numbers within () represent alternative notes that can for example be used instead when descending.

Iranian classical music make use of European musical notation with two added accidentals.
The sori &#x1D1E9; denotes a quarter tone sharp note.
The koron &#x1D1EA; denotes a quarter tone flat note.
As they are (still!) not always rendered correctly, they could be replaced by the similar symbols > and p respectively.
